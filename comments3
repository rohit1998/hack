I enjoy the video chat aspect and integration with outlook calendar But you are right it s mostly the same I would say people are overreacting when they are angry about moving more than hey it s great 
It seems more or less the same what does teams do well 
I had to move from slack to teams and was angry at first people were mostly angry about the lack of good giphy integration but I appreciate a lot about it now There s still a few things I d tweak but not a big deal 
This is the real reason in my organization Teams just works whereas Skype for Business was annoying 
I m vary familiar for all the times I have to kill the process when it freezes 
oh god I hated lync too that s hilarious though 
It s just rebranded lync The process is still lyncexe The day it dies will be a happy one 
I ca nt say because I have nt used Slack but I do love the way Teams integrates Office 365 with chat calls file sharing SharePoint calendar meetings and everything else 
only because Skype for business is garbage too but you would nt like it if you had to move from slack to teams 
The two services are very different though and serve different customers There s clearly room for both and a bit of healthy competition will only result in better features for both apps in the long run 
It s not so much that specific features are missing but rather ease of use and polish is completely missing I ca nt hide the side panel with all of my chats listed on teams hot keys are abysmal searching is superior in slack It s small things that the slack team has had time to polish teams I m sure will get there but it s not there yet I will say the addition of sharepoint on the backend of a teams team is a nice touch and extremely useful if used correctly They both have their positives and negatives for me currently slack is a much more polished system that s less clunky to use 
I have nt used Microsoft Teams but what features are lacking from Slack Slack is a chat room and private message app It became a thing because it let users post emojis and animated GIF memes And it let admins and power users write spam bots and play around with webhooks that seldom do anything worthwhile I mean hey I ll give them their due But there s no big technical moat around what Slack does A dozen smaller competitors or open source offerings have copied it all already 
huh 
I m saying I d rather go back to Windows XP than have to use iOS 
U wot mate 
So it s locked down and overall bad 
Teams to SfB is like Windows XP compared to 31 but Slack is like the latest MacOS compared to Windows XP 
I have heard about Slack but honestly have nt seen it in action so ca nt compare it But wow Teams is sooo much better than SfB The mobile Teams app is so far superior to SfB as well It took folks a while to warm up to Teams because it looks and feels so much different than Skype but not that my whole team about 50 folks uses it we LOVE it It does have room for improvement but so far so good 
My company uses SfB I d say 10k employees 
one reason I switched from Slack to Discord is that the web client of slack just kills resources but nice if it works for you 
I hate Discord kills resources worse than both Slack and Teams combined for me and Zoom was compromised quite badly recently 
then at the same time discord and zoom is better than both of them D 
Compared to slack teams is missing a lot of features Compared to skype for business teams is a godsend My company is also switching to teams from SfB Just north of 30K employees I need to actually read these articles to see if they are taking into account the forced move on Microsoft s part 
I swear I think we finished our transition to Skype in September 2018 Now I know why the roll out felt so rushed 
April 1st 2020 yes April Fools day 
And this was last year Starting October 1 2018 new Office 365 customers with fewer than 500 seats will be onboarded to Teams and will not have access to Skype for Business Online 
Any word on when Skype is going away 
Sounds like working for DuPont They used Lotus Notes up until a few years ago and switched to OutlookOffice 365 First step is to just go ahead and completely replace Skype with Teams for chat and calls It has to happen anyway because Skype for Business is going away permanently anyway 
How are channels managed in Teams I work for a very large Corp 25000 world wide with a median employee age above 40yo All my coworkers in authority positions are Boomers and they re still figuring out Skype we used Lotus Notes until we switched to Outlook less than 2 years ago Could I as a fairly lowlevel employee go ahead and setup channels in a way that actually makes sense for our work flow and organization Will they be managed by my Boomer bosses who to their credit honestly try are clueless about digital text communications Or is it managed by IT who have pretty much zero interaction with our products and likely ca nt have any due to security reasons 
You re not migrating anything Microsoft just made an update 
lol yes I completely realize that both Skype and Teams are Microsoft products did you get as far as my second sentence where I said Microsoft is doing away with Skype for Business What s your point anyway I know that much of the backend for Skype and Teams is samesimilar used to be Lync do you remember that but Teams is a different product from Skype and that s what we are migrating to 
Do you realize Microsoft owned Skype for business Your company made no switch 
Yup 
The 7000 employee company I m with is in the process of migrating everyone from Skype for Business to Teams Microsoft is doing away with Skype for Business in the near future Everyone seems to really like Teams that I talk to here which is several dozens of people FWIW 
True but that s a recent addition to the tools and mostly used as a way to say we re cool and hipster a lot like them allowing employees to pick macs Slack does nt get used much but its there 
Actually IBM does use Slack speaking as a former employee 

IBM still uses Lotus Notes a fact which makes me simultaneously cringe and laugh 
Correct 
And Accenture uses Teams 
None of the Big4 has over 300k but Accenture does 
Or any of the big4 consulting firms 
Walmart lol 
Verizon has less than 300k 
Probably Verizon lol 
north of 300k employees IBM or GE P 
My company just did 90k workers although we tend to go back and forth between whichever company gives us a better contract For our laptops it was HP than Dell than HP and now we re apparently staying with Dell for the longterm hah First it was Jabber than Lync than Jabber and now we re switching to Teams and removing all our phones and using some system on our laptops Going to be great 
17k employee org here Switching to teams next month 
Slack has revolutionized how my team works If my company tells us to use MS it would be a shitshow 
What Obviously you are clueless to what you re talking about 
deleted 
Microsoft owned Skype for business though so they re not switching 
You re so dumb 
Yeah very large corporations will likely go with teams vs slack Mine has north of 300k employees and switching over to teams from Skype for business So these numbers will go up 
This program is not designed for team 
Skype is a marvel in a product somehow getting worse with each and every update It s almost completely unusable for me Either it logs me out and refuses to log me back in or it does nt connect the call I m trying to make or I m on my phone and it randomly vibrates for no reason I ve never seen so many people put so much trust into a product that manages to work flawlessly only about 20 of the time I m using it Teams is better but not by much 
My office has Office 365 and we re moving over to Slack Ironically we re moving to Slack because we were previously using Skype which has completely gone down the shitter ever since Microsoft took it over 
The transformation really only comes when you start building bots and workflows that integrate directly with Teams Most companies do nt really get that far 
It is just a chat app in the same way a shitty netbook and a MacBook pro are just laptops Slack has been a game changer at least for sometimes remote tech teams 
It s cloud IRC with a REST API in front of it 
IRC with threaded conversations is how I always describe it 
That s exactly how I view it 
Sounds like IRC for business 
Just a couple real world examples from my world Google Docs will notify you right in Slack that someone commented at you in a document You can reply to the comment right from slack or click the link over to Docs We can post tasks directly to our Project management software with their Slack integration In a lot of cases it has replaced emails for notifications etc 
You can connect it to Salesforce and approvereject a nonstandard request like a large discount or more favorable payment or price increase terms and have seamless integration with Chatter the chat feed on a particular recordaccount so that the discussion itself is selfdocumenting 
That s just it we have it and it does nt seem to have changed a damn thing So I was nt sure if it was something we totally missed or if it does nt really work for us 
That is one use case out of a million The easiest answer would be to try it 
You connect it to github and jira Seems like you have to be a programmercoder for it to be useful then 
You connect it to github and jira From there you get a realtimestream of all activity into a dedicated room of what is transpiring 
I guess I ll just have to wait till I m at a company that uses it to it s full potential because I literally have no idea how that would work at my company There s no integrations that I can think of us using because I m not sure I can understand what the integrations are in a real world example that applies to my job 
I disagree These chat apps like Slack allow for a lot of integrations Pull data straight from your necessary databases and display it all for your team to see in Slack Teams Cloud based organizations become managing a breeze People on every continent and timezone Also the channel organizations and chat threading allow text based communication on a level I have nt seen in plain messenger type chat apps before 
It is just a chat app But with an easier simpler and better UX And a better UX is enough of a difference to build multibillion dollar businesses 
Teams has superior threading 
It s pretty good If you can remember I d love to know It also links well with Google cloud We ve built some chatbots in it using pubsub dialogflow and cloud functions It s sweet 
You know the silly thing is that we already have GSuite and Google Chat would have been perfect for us I honestly ca nt remember the details but there was something on the administrative side of Google Chat that made me as IT director say fuck it 
What about Google Chat 
Agreed I demoed several chat apps after HipChat was turned off so many have shitty UI or difficult to use or ridiculous setup complexity Slack has none of that Something as simple as chat is way too hard to find a good app 
Slack is a chat app done so well you do nt need email among other things anymore You can think of any alert or bot or notification or assignment task manager and you can build it right into your company s Slack It s a one stop shop for ALL company communications Note I have no affiliation with Slack I used it at a handful of startups before joining Google After git Slack is the tool I miss most 
From what I see a lot of email conversations that would have previously been email have now moved onto slack Not what I d consider a game changer Programmer APIs can make it more flexible than other chat apps I have used As one example my team uses Geekbot for our morning SCRUM A quick daily touch base for programmer that is part of the agile methodology One less meeting that interrupts us We also have channels that get slack notifications from systems we use for example telling us a new code changes are ready for review or that our app automatically built and deployed to a specific location One team in my org even built their own Slack integration bot so you can use to find information from our backend systems Additionally as a distributed team who works with people across multiple countries and time zones some Slack Channels act like the water cooler for interactions you would normally only get in person such as chatting about the latest Game of Thrones episode or Star Wars movie I expect all of the above scenarios would have occurred in some different manner even if we were nt using Slack though It is slightly more complex than a simple chat app but I do not think it is changing the way anyone does business It is just a small morph in the medium where some interactions take place 
Like all our clients have slack and it s kind of cool that we can have a shared channel that we can message each other on even though we all have different corporate slack accounts 
Wrong 
Do nt tell me what to do 
Describe to me what makes this true in your mind 
Teams is just a chat app Slack is a commutation and information sharing platform Honestly teams does nt deserve to be in the same breath as slack but teams has the power of MS behind it so I give them some benefit 
I am realizing that now from the comments I ve never used Slack only Teams I kept hearing that Slack and Teams as a clone of Slack would change the way you do business and how the entire organization functions and I thought maybe there was some use case that I was totally missing because it seemed like a simple chat app Turns out it is just a chat app 
IF you already have use a chat app then you already know the point of Slack It is another option for a chat app 
I just commented on the features I used by working on software but these tools also have integrations for other industries 
Gotcha I m not a coder so it definitely does nt seem like it would make a real difference for my job 
Yes most teams I worked on use Slack MS Teams or Chime from Amazon 
You can also manage your sprint process by integrating with Jira or Trello and manage your code release process by integrating with GitHub All in the same app So it would be useful if I was a coder 
It s all about integrations chatting with your team you can do it in tens of different apps Both Slack and Teams have great support for integrations For instance you can have a channel where you get your customer feedback even if it was sent from a contact form on your web and reply directly there You can also manage your sprint process by integrating with Jira or Trello and manage your code release process by integrating with GitHub All in the same app 
At work we use it to assign task to each other and if we use the person in the email it tries to make a task or something 
I just do nt get the point of it We already have a shared server and a chat app what does Teams do for me What is the point of Slack 
I think Office Groove from 2007 takes the cake for the weirdest and most disjointed app 
Basically If you have Office 365 in the workplace you get Teams whether you want it or not It s personally not my favorite Office program because its UI is so unlike any other Office programs and it does nt even integrate with the notification stack of Windows 10 It s like a weird wannabe program 
Mine ditched it and returned to slack We still technically have it and so does everyone else with a 365 in my company I would think but not a single one actually use it 
That s probably your 50 tabs open in chrome 
Teams is decent for virtual meetings but the thing is a memory hog My computer slows to a crawl if I m using Outlook Teams and Chrome at the same time which is all the time I d go back to Slack in a heartbeat if it were nt for my company forcing us to use it 
Teams has more potential than Slack IMHO because of the SharePoint integration When you set up a new Team it also automatically creates a new SharePoint site for file storage etc for that team Our company is moving to reorganizing all of our filing along these lines and it means that every project can spin up a new Team and immediately have a centralized spot for all of that project s communications notes and files Im sure you can set up a similar system with slack and dropbox and stuff but the out of the box nature of Teams is what really convinced our company to reorganize along these lines 
Teams comes bundled with Office365 so it s effectively free if you use that 
Basically this If I was personally paying for it I m not sure why I d chose Teams over Slack at this point unless Teams becomes a much better product MS fanboys or really fanboys of any company get hyped seeing headlines like this but just because something is the most popular does nt necessarily mean its a better product or that people like using it more Same could be said about Outlook 
We have both and exclusively use slack 
If your company previously used Skype for Business it s a dream come true 
And that s probably not going to change MS is already integrated in the office and also does nt sound like an app you use to chat and slack off 
Sounds like windows and MSDOS Seriously do nt mistake corporate dollars for adoption Microsoft has nt done much to evolve the user experience in teams and I do nt see them trying It s a cluster fuck and people are going to migrate off quickly 
I dream of the day that my work will use Gmail for its instead of Outlook for work 
THIS THIS THIS 
I only use it because my company forces me to Pretty much everyone 
What They are rolling out small to moderate improvements at a pretty good pace 
It gets updates frequently Just the past few weeks they ve really improved their meetings ui 
They recently added screen sharing Getting closer to replacing Skype with it 
No Slack is actually nicer to use in my opinion Since Office 365 is growing so well and as it s bundled up with it recent build updates of Office are starting to add Teams It s inevitabley replacing Skype for Business anyone company that uses that has been the focus to transition over Basically it s seen as a valueadded product and since it s free might as well use it 
But then why is it growing faster than Slack Does Slack just suck that much 
I deleted a message just yesterday windows app 
Yes you can 
Of course you can 
You ca nt fucking delete messages or convos I hate that so much Edit I run windows 2007 and there s no option to delete the messages even has a nice little pop up box that says we currently do nt have that feature but we are working on it 
Keyword could Teams has nt improved much since its initial beta release 
Teams is nt just a standalone messaging app It is very much still Skype for Business with VoIP phone number dialin out but now has full collaboration with the Office suite Share and work on Office documents directly within the the Teams app If you re fully utilizing the Office 365 suite for your business Teams becomes the central point It s still shit and buggy as hell but the selling points do add a lot more value than what any 3rd party app could attempt 
I do nt know how we already have GitHub integration with Slack that already does more than it probably should What do you suggest Microsoft could offer that is nt more of the same It seems people are migrating for other reasons I do nt think this would be one of them 
A connector was released in June 
Its a no brainer for some of us I own a digital agency and we had slack but also use O365 We already have a full sharepoint installation that was customised and eventually we just looked at it and went why would we pay for slack when Teams is free when you have O365 Might not be 100 a copy of slack but it does the job 
My guess is this is coming There s some hooks with azure Dev ops already that are fairly useful 
for Highly Confidential types of information specs or code 
Github is still on the banned and discouraged list for Microsoft workers 

Agreed The company I am with has a contract with Microsoft since we use Net and now they are transitioning us to use other Microsoft tools like Teams and Skype instead of Google products 
TEAMS sucks It offers way more control and supervision for admins It has all the charm and personality of Windows Vista 
this would change virtually nothing as there is already a slackgithub integration that is very good the only way this would change anything is if github revoked the slack integration but in my opinion this would just cause a mass migration away from anything MSFT touches 
Github is integrated already 
Probably not a good idea 
Google uses some inhouse thing with a git interface afaik 
What do you use 
A lot of the big companies use perforce Google uses a homebrew perforcelike system 
That s definitely not why we do nt use Github at Google We do nt even use git 
That s because it s their competitor s product Amazon does nt use G Suite either but guess what G Suite is massive Edit I really question any of your logic if you think Microsoft does nt use GitHub 
Google and Facebook do nt use GitHub except for open source projects 
manage their own source control Uh what is it you think GitHub does 
Yeah it s not really worth responding to everyone If they ever work at one of these superscale companies they d see it s just way easier to manage source control rather than going through a third party 
Git is nt suitable for scale Perforce s sparse clients make it a must for very large code bases 
I would be surprised if Microsoft quickly ported all their code onto github but I guess it s been a few years I think and maybe But the idea that big tech is buying githb instances to run in their cloud sounds very incorrect to me I can only speak for Google though We absolutely definitely and this will never change are not Our shit is wayyy to complicated for that and why would nt we have our own engineers control it soup to nuts 
Yeah that person got shredded and is 100 correct I have nt worked at Microsoft since the GitHub acquisition but at least prior to that they were also in the list lol 
Google literally has their own proprietary source control for their internal development 
No I certainly do nt mean that 
deleted 
They re not saying the companies use a proprietary source control but manage their own ie have their own git server vs using github 
deleted 
I love that you re downvoted to hell We are definitely managing our own source code at Google I d be very surprised if FB is nt either Or Amazon Reddit is so funny with upvotes and downvotes 
Facebook runs mercurial now with GitHub for open source projects 
I know for a fact Facebook used to a la phabricator 
Google and Facebook are definitely managing their own repos besides for open source projects 
Absolutely wrong GitHub Enterprise is very popular as well as BitBucket enterprise No big company is managing their own source control 
Sorry I thought you meant deploy their own version control and have a separate task tool Yeah they do nt really use git because of monorepo scaling issues There may be some repos that have nt been migrated to something else yet but for the most part they use other version control software 
deleted 
People do it eg Facebook and Google You use a separate tool for tasks 
deleted 
yes 
deleted 


deleted 
No git is the product managing them GitHub is not Git It s a Git service 
Yeah I m not sure if that s what he means Where I m at one of the top 10 largest hedge funds in the world by AUM we use our own internallyhosted Bitbucket server 
deleted 
Google uses Perforce Facebook uses Mercurial not too sure what Amazon uses 
When people are talking about scale they are talking about these internetscale companies not banks 
Git does nt scale well Excuse me He s completely right which is why huge companies with monorepos do nt use it It s awful at scale Facebook Mozilla and Java all use mercurial 
deleted 
So what is wrong with selfhosting a github enterprise instance 
They released VFS for Git formerly GVFS as an open source project hosted on GitHub allowing Git to scale and merged their customizations upstream with mainline Git For all intents and purposes Windows is on Git 
They had to heavily customize git when they moved from perforce They are nt using vanilla git code 
You realize Windows probably the work s largest single codebase is on Git 
This is what I meant git does nt scale that well in a monorepo environment so some companies have looked towards other vcs as well such as mercurial 
It means hosting your own git repos on your servers 
Yeah I probably should ve been clearer that I meant internetscale companies Rereading my comment I realize that the meaning is up to the interpretation of large Still though just by considering internetscale companies I would guess that GitHub isnt used by nearly 100 of tech workers as the original comment states 
I work at a much smaller company 10k employees and we also do nt use git It would nt work effectively for our repos without heavy modification I d say that s true for any companies with large repos 
He s getting downvoted for saying big companies do nt use GitHub Just because the very top 1 of companies does nt use GitHub or BitBucket does nt mean tons of massive companies do nt I work at one of those superscale companies that does nt use GitHub either and he s still wrong 
ITT people who do nt understand source control and big tech companies Github git and Github and Bitbucket are the only places to store code Deviate from the above and get downvoted 
Fucking Christ Github is not the only way to manage your own source control There is gitlab bitbucket and plentyof other way to manage both git and nongit based source control systems I work at a small 500 sized company that barely knows how to program its own way out of a paper bag and even we have our own self hosted gitlab based source control system 
deleted 
What does proprietary have to do with self hosted Every majors company hosts their own source control 
deleted 
What the fuck does it even mean for a company to manage their own source control Is this a joke 
deleted 
Lol what All kinds of huge companies use GitHub Completely false 
C but up until about a year ago we were stuck on NET 35CF 
You poor tormented soul If you tell me that it is a gigantic monolith in a legacy language I will weep for you 
The billion dollar company I work for still uses SVN can you kill me now 
I suppose he did get heavy handed with the no companies 
He said larger companies do nt use GitHub He was nt misunderstood He was wrong He got spanked for it and is now trying to backpedal into a I meant they do use selfhosted GitHub enterprise instances that they pay licensing fees for but not the GitHub hosted plan position bares no resemblance to his initial statements 
This is what I meant 
I feel like his argument was saying a lot of companies host their own version control git or any other version control basically separating GitHub from git Guy is getting lit up but I think he s being misunderstood 
Running your own github enterprise instance does I can delete the bit about and other selfhosted git servers and I d still be marginally less correct if that makes you happy 
or some other selfhosted git server Running your own git server does nt mean you have anything to do with Github the company 
You do nt know what the fuck you are talking about Nearly every Fortune 500 company uses github Enterprise You probably did nt know github had enterprise software because you are probably still a CS student or work at a shitty dev shop or one would be lead to think so considering you think github has no enterprise foothold 
they only recently switched and it required a lot of customisation It s still fairly rare in large software companies with unified repositories or big products 
Lol 100 Microsoft uses Github in fact it s the biggest contributor and you can look at all the repos 
yikes lol which penny stock do i buy please advise 
GitHub is used by small companies but no way it s used by larger companies since it s probably cheaper and easier to manage their own source control at scale I doubt Microsoft even uses it 
deleted 
I would say they re already there in terms of flavor Or at least Impossible is If you never told me I was eating a veggies burger I would have assumed I was eating a plain wellmediumwell burger The issue is Impossible is much more expensive 
I hope they do but this is the Tesla story all over again Cars are somewhat more difficult to build than flavor but once manufacturers have electrics that can drive x miles or healthy veggie meat that is indistinguishable from real meat the initial creator loses their edge 
The slightly better boca burger a little harsh having tried boca impossible and beyond impossible and beyond are about mediocre neighborhood BBQ level while boca is still solidly veggie burger level is highly valued because if they succeed they could disrupt the entire beef industry They wo nt topple the meat industry but they will steal a good portion of the market 
Not at all if he s saying that those 2 are better than the rest of the field 
Does nt that undermine your point about one being better than the other Lol 
It s beyond and it s not even as good as the impossible 
I am aware just could nt remember which one had a super high valuation currently 
Those are not the same company 
that s not how it works 
An edge sure I ll give you the 05 in that 105B valuation for that edge 
I agree that valuation is high but the ImpossibleBeyond burger I think really has an edge over its competitors 
A company that makes a slightly better boca burger is worth 105B The whole market is busted 
I was just speaking in general terms 999 of the time you could build an application for far far cheaper than what these companies are acquired for or valued at The value comes from the users 
I understand that valuation if you have 16 of the populations of the planet Earth using your app but Slack Come on 
Not the same obviously Getting new users costs 510X more than retaining existing ones 
That s the same as paying for users 
Facebook actually paid for not losing users to WhatsApp WhatsApp was taking away eyeballs and session time from FB bigtime 
You re paying for the users not the application 
Damn that s a great point it s literally a messaging app 
WhatsApp was acquired for 193B 
If they do it well like they re doing it and they get customers and they get revenue and that revenue justifies the price then it s not overvalued 
If this is all you see then you re missing the big picture 
True Could result in a serious correction 
still so many lossmaking companies at skyhigh valuations 
But this time the companies actually have revenue Whether or not they justify their valuations is a whole other issue but it is a differentiating factor 
Ca nt fuckin wait for the horrible market correction in a few years We re in the dot com bubble all over again 
I agree with you that what it is today is overvalued But Slack does nt need to be a Microsoft Imagine if they start incorporating B2B advertising in their platform in a way that minimally impacted adoption Suddenly they re a premiere ad platform in the B2B space I m not saying they will be I m just saying their potential is nt defined yet and I think that is what other people not me are investing in 
Yeah jesus a chat app is worth 21B dollar in valuation People is out of their minds 
Everyone will have their own You would think so but apparently not Slack pushed Hipchat out Google messaging is a shit show Remember Facebook at Work or whatever No one else does either MS Teams is going to make it because it can come along for the ride with Office365 Then there is the network effect which Slack has done exceptionally well I am a part of a lot of different Slacks for different topics It s easier to share channels with partners who also use Slack Slack took IRC and made it for the masses The moat at this point is the network 
Its like this stuff is pretty valuable but the problem is that there just are nt moats for these things Everyone will have their own 
Slack step 1 store all your internal conversations on our servers 
Slack won on UX and almost purely UX IRC provided a lot of flexibility and choice but that s not something most users want Apparently what most users want from their communication tool is Easy to get to the communicating part hosted web client is super low barrier to entry Easy to discover the channels they want to be in Easily display images 
No it has nt IRC has always been superior to Slack and did things right that Slack gets wrong Slack security alone is a fucking joke 
Many companies have their own email servers they do nt want to give their data to a thirdparty They just need to do the same with instant messaging If a free and wellintegrated client popsin that ll put a big strain on those apps 
but the entire company to be based on that one product is silly That would be fine in some cases but slack is chat app It not something special 
Slack has always been overglorified IRC Makes sense to be one of the products a software company offers but the entire company to be based on that one product is silly 
You would nt necessarily need to buy the customers if you are aiming for GSuite companies Lots of smaller companies are on GSuite Slack I know for sure that my company would switch in a heartbeat if that happened and they could save money 
But part of what you re buying are the customers as well as the product 
In theory the human resource cost to build a competitor is a lot lower than the cost to acquire 51 of Slack But this is google so you re not wrong 
Whichever one is your favorite make sure to let them know so that they can cancel that one too 
Already killed 4 
And announced 5 new 
They just canceled 6 of them though 
5 of them will only get support though and then canned after 6 years 
They are building 8 of their own thing 
Lol damn I had to double check whether you were making a joke or not Google moves from gchat hangouts google chat which is apparently technically called google hangouts chat rofl Could they just pick a name Two years later Introducing Google Allo Hangouts Chat Mail 
External access is coming very soon 
Yup it s called Google Chat They just released it It s to replace Hangouts My company just switched to it So far nothing is really different You still have your channels and DMs One downside is that you ca nt have people outside of your organization in So think contractors I ve noticed that someone can DM you and it ll take a few seconds for a notification to show on the windows OS Aside from those it s been good to use 
Did nt they already build that And called it Wave 
I ve heard Google is building their own thing 
They have Wave it was basically slack but was never curated well The bones are there though 
Google would probably be better off buying slack 
RIP Inbox the greatest email app of all time 
They ll build it twice deprecate one of them rename it a few times then cancel the whole thing 5 years later 
Googles chat apps have always been good it s just they were tagretting messenger and wahtsapp which had too much market share to be toppled 
Err Google already has and is currently heavily investing in a Slacklike chat app called Hangouts Chat set to replace the old Hangouts 
As someone with extensive experience using both applications Microsoft definitely did not rip off Slack for Teams VisuallyUIwise Teams feels like what Skype should have been a fully integrated chat app that plays well with the rest of the Office ecosystem right down to editing documents within a chat window Also reliable video and audio chat that has become pitifully unreliable on Skype Google wo nt build a chat app anytime soon because they are focused on changes in the adtech space specifically that Amazon Bing are growing quickly and that the former is becoming an ad behemoth Also because they are focused on Stadia I guess EDIT To clarify Bing s growth in 2019 this is largely driven by Yahoo integrating Bing as their search platform 
Google could do it they basically did over a decade ago with Wave but there was no demand for it at the time Same goes for Microsoft with tabletssmartphones and AOL with Instant Messaging in general As much as people chastise these companies for missing key technologies almost all of the company had early offerings long before technologies really took off and simply failed due to a lack of timing hardware not being good enough or there being no clear path to monetization at the time There s almost nothing really novel about Slack it was just in the right place at the right time and smart enough to build a decent API for third party software integration 
Slack is really the chat app with the best UX Google is not historically known for building and keeping good UX for their products 
If you have GSuite for business there s chatgooglecom Hangouts is being deprecated 
This is why I m bearish on Slack If Google can ever figure out to rip it off wholesale the same way Microsoft did with Teams and then offer it for free to GSuite companies many of Slack s users will jump ship The counter point to this would be that Google is famously bad at developing chat apps so we ll see what happens 
I know teams who have a bot who just dumps the history and can be used to search that so you bypass to 10000 message 
I could nt believe how expensive going to the enterprise licence with Slack is JUST to get SAML sign in It costs MORE than most of my mid tier Office 365 subscriptions per user and those subscriptions include email teams and SharePoint I think the only reason Slack is popular is a SINGLE small dev team can get away with free accounts and no sign in integration other than personal gmail accounts 
Revive Novell 
Apple maybe Especially given their efforts in expanding their service offerings 
Slack waited until Microsoft had a working competitor integrated into its Office 365 suite to go public Big organizations can either use Office for X per year or use Slack AND Office for approximately double And they did nt go public because they needed more capital to execute their strategy they just did so so give their seed investors and employees some liquidity I do nt see how they survive on their own honestly Google wo nt want them since they have hangouts But maybe shudder a player like Oracle would take them It might seem wierd but as much as devs hate them they also use their product like Virtualbox MySQL still even though MariaDB came out and so forth Who knows 
The no network effects thing is very true Any software boss can just pull Slack under the rug and devs basically have to live with it Just like Github is the superior product but many devs have to live with Bitbucket because its cheaper Same could happen to Slack vs Teams 
They can be exported in a json format But it does nt get private messages and channels but it would be good enough 
You d lose all the archived conversations unless they can be exported and imported in to Teams Slack Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge 
Thing is Slack does not have as a pronounced network effect vs other sort of apps If my boss makes me use Groupme or teams or whatever I ll just use that I do nt really have a choice and I dont really care If MS team can integrate it into their office suite they re just going to straight up beat everyone else in the corporate space 
Nadella is fantastic for that company Has changed a lot of their business practices and culture No it s not perfect I m not saying that But today s Microsoft is a very different company 
Marketing is a powerful thing 
I noticed that millennials at my office are A OK with Microsoft It s gen Xers like myself who remember the lies the shady practices the awful software they made in the nineties that are allergic to Microsoft I want nothing to do with that company The tech world would be decades ahead if Microsoft never existed 
I agree with your last point but its not like msft hasnt earned some hate 
thats understandable Microsoft has improved a ton over the last 5 or 6 years and made huge improvements It may not be the best solution at all times but people just shit on it constantly and not give a chance I m not saying your doing that but i ve worked with so many people over the years that just shit on it and refuse to use their products One that blows my mind right now is in the business intelligence area Tableau which is now salesforce vs powerBI microsoft I ve seen so much money wasted on tableau when powerbi is way cheaper and offers essentially the same product with a ton more features Yes tableau offers better visuals but powerbi offers a full blown BI solution including ETL for almost half the price obviously microsoft is not the right solution for every business problem but it gets shit too much by haters 
I fucking ca nt stand Microsoft Windows I m spoiled by UNIX systems that are tiny fast secure and actually work but there is a logical reason why Windows is still so far behind everything else despite leading the market Backwards compatibility Basically every version of Windows since NT is running the same kernel Makes it sound like they re just lazy and stupid until you dig into it and realize it s what their customers are asking for At that point shit give em what they want I m much happier at work since I started bringing an old Linux laptop to work on It s about 8 years old and runs far better than the shiny new Windows machine they gave me that now collects dust in my bedroom 
people have so much hate for microsoft they just slam everything they put out even when microsoft has a solution to their problem to make their work easier instead they take the most ascine ass backwards way to not use a microsoft product In this case if you have office 365 at your organization there is absolutely zero need for slack ZERO 
I m skeptical They have nt made a client better than MSN messenger since what 2002 
Teams will eventually replace it at least that is the plan I believe 
lol even Microsoft ca nt make skype better after how many iterations and rebuilds i m shocked it still exists 
If Skype was the bar to beat 
You ca nt call someone over email 
that s the reason I do nt use skype at work because all it is in the end is an email saved in a different folder and now I have to maintain that folder so I just keep sending emails because there s no added value 
Archived chats in the same instance as the app Skype would save conversation history in our Outlook and delete them in Skype This was a revolutionary feature apparently It also hooks up to share point which is nice for editing docs collaboratively and grabbing things easily Along with that UI was immensely improved 
Teams can blur out the background when you have your webcam on 
What s the background blur feature 
Meeting recording are online and do not tie up the local client processing a video for half an hour after a meeting chat data persists in the app instead of being copied as messages to exchange outlook Meeting calendaring is built in instead of external in exchange outlook you can dependably open teams and immediately start the meeting scheduled without waiting for exchange to respond like in Skype the background blur feature is actually handy you get meeting notices the moment the first participant joins and it auto mutes your mic if you join an already in progress meeting The ONLY thing I miss from Skype for Business is the small contact list I wish they would release a compact mode option 
In what ways is it better than Skype Except that you can send GIFs 
Teams is shit It s overcomplicated without any benefit Why have teams and then chat They should just have one option like slack Also notifications are nonexistent for teams but I get them on chat so nobody ever used teams part of teams anyway I guess it s kind of nice that the business is too dumb to use anything that IT does nt put on their computer and the developers can continue to use slack without the business having unwanted input 
Yeah there are some slack fanboys up in here Teams does literally everything I expect out of a communication app We just switched from Skype and holy shit is it leagues ahead 
Yeah I do nt understand the hate Slack has a marginally better UI but Teams has a lot of features Slack does nt I just migrated my 150 person company from Slack to Teams Sorry Reddit 
You re missing half of what slack offers the built in apps webhook capabilities and other integrations allow you to automate monitoring of your applications and development cycle not to mention easily create custom apps for different purposes There IS an advantage to slack if you re in the IT organization but if you re just looking for a chat app then yeah you re right 
Custom emojis Haha 
we use both slack and teams and slack offers zero advantage over teams 
You should know better 
The UI is my only real issue with teams Especially trying to go back in chat history and having to wait for messages to load Otherwise I really love the way it integrates with Office 365 
I ve used both and prefer Slack over Teams Teams UIUX is clunky it feels like the interface was made by Google or Facebook I expect better from Microsoft 
Yeah but it s shit 
Discord is good but turning mic on in a chat always feels weird why would i press Talkers 
I last tried to use Teams a little bit more than a year ago I felt like it was years behind Slack and not even as good as Riot or Mattermost the two top open source competitors in the space I ve used both and prefer the latter Tbh Discord is stonking great I admin a 2000 person Slack If we started again from scratch it d be on Discord Now we are too locked in because of the network effect of Slack use it for work and it s really easy to use it for social and worktangential stuff at the same time and still look like you re doing work 
Such silly metrics This is Skype users All business Skype is now being accounted as teams I sell this stuff Microsoft is so good at messing with metrics to hide really what s happening 
Holdin my Slack stock bag now 
Have you been on the Teams feature request page it s like a depressing graveyard of hugely upvoted requests that are 18 months or older with status like considering implementing in stages and working on it development is painfully slow It may have frequent updates but in the year I ve used it no updates have been of much significance Slack is loved by the team I work in and we re all supposed to use Teams and nobody does despite them all being logged in 
Especially these days 
Yeah but his points generalize to Microsoft products in general these days This breakdown sounds almost exactly the same as how I described Outlook vs Gmail the other day Microsoft still has enough resources to make their own version of any software But their version is always the worst one and people hate having to use it Microsoft developers are out of touch with how humans want to use programs 
Given that you re a developer I think you ll agree that a lot changes in 25 years Teams was officially released in March of 2017 so you were effectively using new software that was bound to be buggy I m not saying Teams is nt without its issues my grievances are namely around usability but I think you re being unfair to software that has a weekly update cadence I used it when it first came out and it s improved a ton from where it used to be IMHO Slack is a better overall experience but not compelling enough to make me want to pay more for it over Teams if I had to choose 
Wait you re basing your opinion off of using something 25 years ago We did a pilot with it a year ago and decided to stick with slack due to the lack of integration and clunky UI Last month we revisited our decision because MS has added so many features and integrations One of the most powerful features is the fact that the file system is backed by SharePoint which can be synced across the entire team via OneDrive allowing our entire company to have a single source for the most up to date documents AND a built in DR cloud solution as well as versioning Add that to the daily growing integration to other MS services 3rd party services and webhooks and it becomes pretty apparent the value proposition of teams Now if your organization is nt O365 Teams does nt make sense but 90 of the corporate world is 
Same situation and 100 agreed with all your points You saved me a lot of typing 
Have Teams open right now and it s using 690 MB of memory 
What happens when the free money the economy has been fueled on runs out Do 1000person companies really need to pay for the equivalent of 1020 people a month just for a slightly nicer but redundant app that is already provided with the Office bundle 
Im a developer and have used both tools A brief review of each MSFT Teams No one really likes this Everyone I have worked with and talked to about it was very happy to get off of it Its generally used I suspect because it comes bundled with the Office suite almost all companies buy It does nt work all that well so they lose customers within a few years From a technical standpoint the software is NOT good It used 3GB of ram last time I ran it about 25 years ago when its running which is absolutely not necessary Slack Pretty much everyone really likes this and when they are nt on it makes noises about switching to it It is set up to allow for easy integrations has a clean and simple UI handles sending code snippets better than any other chat tool I ve used and has the all important giphy bot which makes conversations a lot more fun It is also much lighter on your system than Teams So knowing the tools and being in the target demographic for them I do nt think Slack is in much danger longterm and would happily invest in them given a good price point 
Rocketchat is better 
Any love for Mattermost 
That is all well and good I use Teams at work and Slack for my own personal use Must say Teams is the pits I do not like it one single bit I do not care what the heck else they integrate with it It is terrible software 
I fucking love Microsoft At some point they realized they were no longer interested in competing with Apple and saw an unmet need in Office and the Cloud Steve Balmer got a lot of shit for being a giant asshole but he s done great things Nadella is a great CEO as well MSFT has really thrived by serving businesses rather than consumers 
Ok but when you need to integrate slack into your environment and start looking into their SMAL offerings the pricing does nt make sense 350 per user per year for the Enterprise Grid For a chat app Thats almost the same as an Office 365 E5 license It s just not feasible if you re already heavily Microsoft based and already paying for the E5 license or even E3 If you re not Microsoft based and using Googles suite then it makes sense as there has nt been anything up to now that comes close from G s world The usability of Teams is nt even that bad its just not as good as Slack 
Microsoft has and always will do a great job of making IT lives easier user experience takes a back seat to that though I ve noticed the younger generations wising up and demanding better experiences They re driving Apple adoption in the enterprise and want Slack Trello Box etc Just on the Mac side alone they sell this story that the Mac is nt a second class citizen anymore but spend 5 minutes with the two Outlook versions side by side and you ll see they re full of shit You can greatly reduce an already inflated Microsoft E subscription if your leadership has the guts to stop putting all their eggs in the Microsoft basket and look at more exciting vendors like Slack or Trello Atlassian I know I paraphrase a quote start with the user experience and work your way back to IT IT people are mostly smart make their job challenging not the Users 
From a securityIT admin point of view it s a lot easier just to integrate Microsoft into everything as opposed to having multiple providersNot saying the product is any better just for the IT staff it s a lot less of a headache 
For a long time Microsoft was a dysfunctional company falling behind competitors in several areas But now they have successfully branched out into the cloud with Azure and other platforms They have eroded EMC s market share with HyperV and other offerings and now this As an IT professional I adit that I do nt particularly like their products save for their frontoffice applications and databases but I ca nt deny their ability to dominate MS stock is one you hold for life basically 
Yeah because it s forced onto people who would rather have Slack but corporate only wants to pay Microsoft Teams sucks 
Teams is utter garbage People only use it because it is part of the Office suite Many of these companies probably would not have shelled out for Slack regardless 
Kind of expected 
That s some shady shit imo 
They have an installer that they install in addition to Teams You have to uninstall it as well 
Also I have an impossible time trying to remove teams from my work computer I uninstall and it magically reinstalls Btw it s my company not like a random corporate computer 
Same We are all migrating to teams My employees love it The functionality is only getting better and we utilize the chat rooms daily I went from my employees having multiple little chats Skype to visibility in a single convo It s great for transparency and you can email the rooms or join via links All about it Shifts and the project like functions are working great too 
I have not seen anyone mention the fact that Teams lets you download chat logs without paying extra but Slack charges tons of money for it We switched from Slack to Teams for that reason Everyone was afraid Teams would be terrible but it s not bad at all It s slightly harder to send gifs but that s about the only downside 
As an engineer who has worked with both Teams is the better deal and Slack is the better product My gut is that a largerthannormal of that 13 million actively wishes they were using Slack instead but the companies they work for went with the better deal because office suite does nt realize what a difference it makes I know from experience Does nt make a diff to these companies bottom lines but food for thought 
If you can use Teams as part of the Office sub you already pay for why pay extra for Slack 
I feel like anecdotally this is simply the legions of users migrating off the terrible Skype For Business Microsoft shops staying Microsoft shops does nt strike me as sensational 
We moved from Slack to Teams and it just integrates into so many parts of our business better Microsoft has been doing some great stuff lately and really hitting user experience out of the park 
Takeover target 
My company is trying to switch us to teams because it s no extra cost on their office license Makes sense they are getting more users faster 
So besides electronic dogleashing and recording everything you have said why is the utility of Teams for an organization 
Always fun trying to explain to new users howto reply correctly to a thread in teams instead of making new topics Not the best UI and has nt progressed in a year Slack was simpler for people at my workplace But both have their advantagesdisadvantages I guess 
I do nt know we re at like 9 per user right now Looking to reduce Microsoft down to email and office to justify the more platform agnostic alternatives It s a tough sell for sure You ca nt sustain both and you have to make a decision on the future of your environment 
Slack was great up until early 2017 when Microsoft Teams took off 
Our company is moving to teams due to office 365 It s just a cheaper option I hate it so far 
This is surprising that they re releasing these numbers so late They ll double the DAUs in the next 6 months easily They have a total O365 base of 75100 million 
But you dont have to use it So if they have that many users those are people choosing to use it 
OOF BEING FORCED TO USE A BUNDLED PROGRAM 
Slack is way better than Teams MS is practically forcing Teams adoption by bundling it with Office365 
I learned this yesterday 
Teams is cheaper than Slack 
It s only because Skype for Business is terrible and in KTLO 
I ca nt believe I have nt seen comments about Slack s memory issues when trying to use multiple workspaces at the same time 
it s a shame since teams fucking sucks compared to slack This is literally microsoft mostly heavily undercutting the price 
Our company has both They ve run out of slack licenses so they re trying to get people to use Teams I think one group uses it cause they ca nt get licenses Everyone else is on Slack 
I m an Apple fan myself Trying to switch back to Windows after spending time on a Mac is like slamming your head against the wall repeatedly the pain goes away after a little while due to the numbness but it s still there 
Microsoft teams sucks and I m so glad I do nt have to touch that garbage for awhile 
Totally ignores the situation of the two products in question one is free and one is expensive 
This always happens Startups rarely succeed Multinationals copy their ideas and use marketingmarket share to dominate new product areas This sub and most other subs on Reddit deny this trend and root for the underdog because the reality of the situation is dispiriting 
It s a reasonable speculative investment at 800 million At 21 billion it s pure insanity 
Slack is the silliest investment ever Literally hundreds of competitors and so easily replicable 
Microsoft was going to buy out Slack until Bill Gates warned them to improve their own product instead He was totally right 
I m talking about Slack 
I mean what are you expecting It s a messaging app 
I used it before for work and it just seems like a fancy chat room kinda reminded me of my old AOL chat rooms days 
Indeed that seems like the right choice for that task When I was managing large server infrastructure it was always Linux well actually FreeBSD early on but since 2001 or so On the other hand if I was supporting hundreds of of users that were working with Office Exchange Visual Studio Photoshop or whatever else those people were comfortable using and it was mandated we switch everyone to Gnome or KDE I d give my notice the same day 
While ms has certainly has improved in many ways it still comes up short in a lot I support a fortune 7 infrastructure and it runs on linux thousands of servers terabytes of memory and petabytes of critical medical data if it was mandated we move to windows I would give my notice the same day 
I have also worked in tech for 20 years and while it s still not my platform of choice MS is 100x better than it was Most of the complaints I had back then have been addressed in one way or another It s worth updating perceptions as things change I still prefer unix though and install Cygwin whenever I have to work on Windows for an extended period of time 
They dominate because they have name recognition and have trapped a lot of business I have worked in tech for 20 years lots of thir stuff is shit I started with ms and moved to unix because windows stability was horrible 
Microsoft dominates because they have a suite of products on which every company depends at least on one of them and they all just kinda work together 
Microsoft dominates market share because they are Microsoft not because they make good products I am not saying slack is better or worse just saying 
I mean free vs not free You decide 
As a person who does not follow any news on communication platforms where do they go from here Cloud based communication tools What separates them from Zoom Skype Teams Etc 
Teams logs me out randomly like 3 times a week 
as a wechat user I still do nt get what functionality I should pay for when looking at slack or teams 
Love Teams But I ve never tried slack
