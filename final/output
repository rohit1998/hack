I have heard about Slack but honestly haven't seen it in action so can't compare it.  But wow Teams is sooo much better than SfB.  The mobile Teams app is so far superior to SfB as well.  It took folks a while to warm up to Teams because it looks and feels so much different than Skype but not that my whole team (about 50 folks) uses it we LOVE it.

It does have room for improvement, but so far so good.


Teams has superior threading.


Teams comes bundled with Office365 so it's effectively free if you use that


Teams logs me out randomly like 3 times a week...
