Slack always overglorified IRC Makes sense one product software company offer entire company based one product silly 
This Im bearish Slack If Google ever figure rip wholesale way Microsoft Teams offer free GSuite company many Slacks user jump ship The counter point would Google famously bad developing chat apps well see happens 
Slack waited Microsoft working competitor integrated Office 365 suite go public Big organization either use Office X per year use Slack AND Office approximately double And nt go public needed capital execute strategy give seed investor employee liquidity I nt see survive honestly Google wo nt want since hangout But maybe shudder player like Oracle would take It might seem wierd much devs hate also use product like Virtualbox MySQL still even though MariaDB came forth Who know 
Thing Slack pronounced network effect v sort apps If bos make use Groupme team whatever I use I nt really choice I dont really care If MS team integrate office suite going straight beat everyone else corporate space 
use slack team slack offer zero advantage team 
I used prefer Slack Teams Teams UIUX clunky feel like interface made Google Facebook I expect better Microsoft 
Yeah shit 
I last tried use Teams little bit year ago I felt like year behind Slack even good Riot Mattermost two top open source competitor space I used prefer latter Tbh Discord stonking great I admin 2000 person Slack If started scratch Discord Now locked network effect Slack use work really easy use social worktangential stuff time still look like work 
Such silly metric This Skype user All business Skype accounted team I sell stuff Microsoft good messing metric hide really happening 
Holdin Slack stock bag 
Im developer used tool A brief review MSFT Teams No one really like Everyone I worked talked happy get Its generally used I suspect come bundled Office suite almost company buy It nt work well lose customer within year From technical standpoint software NOT good It used 3GB ram last time I ran 25 year ago running absolutely necessary Slack Pretty much everyone really like nt make noise switching It set allow easy integration clean simple UI handle sending code snippet better chat tool I used important giphy bot make conversation lot fun It also much lighter system Teams So knowing tool target demographic I nt think Slack much danger longterm would happily invest given good price point 
Any love Mattermost 
That well good I use Teams work Slack personal use Must say Teams pit I like one single bit I care heck else integrate It terrible software 
I fucking love Microsoft At point realized longer interested competing Apple saw unmet need Office Cloud Steve Balmer got lot shit giant asshole done great thing Nadella great CEO well MSFT really thrived serving business rather consumer 
From securityIT admin point view lot easier integrate Microsoft everything opposed multiple providersNot saying product better IT staff lot le headache 
For long time Microsoft dysfunctional company falling behind competitor several area But successfully branched cloud Azure platform They eroded EMCs market share HyperV offering As IT professional I adit I dont particularly like product save frontoffice application database I cant deny ability dominate MS stock one hold life basically 
Yeah forced onto people would rather Slack corporate want pay Microsoft Teams suck 
Teams utter garbage People use part Office suite Many company probably would shelled Slack regardless 
Kind expected 
Also I impossible time trying remove team work computer I uninstall magically reinstalls Btw company like random corporate computer 
Same We migrating team My employee love The functionality getting better utilize chat room daily I went employee multiple little chat Skype visibility single convo Its great transparency email room join via link All Shifts project like function working great 
I seen anyone mention fact Teams let download chat log without paying extra Slack charge ton money We switched Slack Teams reason Everyone afraid Teams would terrible bad It slightly harder send gifs downside 
As engineer worked Teams better deal Slack better product My gut largerthannormal 13 million actively wish using Slack instead company work went better deal office suite doesnt realize difference make I know experience Doesnt make diff company bottom line food thought 
If use Teams part Office sub already pay pay extra Slack 
I feel like anecdotally simply legion user migrating terrible Skype For Business Microsoft shop staying Microsoft shop nt strike sensational 
We moved Slack Teams integrates many part business better Microsoft great stuff lately really hitting user experience park 
Takeover target 
My company trying switch u team extra cost office license Makes sense getting user faster 
So besides electronic dogleashing recording everything said utility Teams organization 
Always fun trying explain new user howto reply correctly thread team instead making new topic Not best UI nt progressed year Slack simpler people workplace But advantagesdisadvantages I guess 
I dont know like 9 per user right Looking reduce Microsoft email office justify platform agnostic alternative Its tough sell sure You cant sustain make decision future environment 
Slack great early 2017 Microsoft Teams took 
Our company moving team due office 365 Its cheaper option I hate far 
This surprising releasing number late They double DAUs next 6 month easily They total O365 base 75100 million 
Slack way better Teams MS practically forcing Teams adoption bundling Office365 
I learned yesterday 
Teams cheaper Slack 
It Skype Business terrible KTLO 
I ca nt believe I nt seen comment Slack memory issue trying use multiple workspace time 
shame since team fucking suck compared slack This literally microsoft mostly heavily undercutting price 
Our company Theyve run slack license theyre trying get people use Teams I think one group us cause cant get license Everyone else Slack 
I Apple fan Trying switch back Windows spending time Mac like slamming head wall repeatedly pain go away little due numbness still 
Microsoft team suck I glad I nt touch garbage awhile 
This always happens Startups rarely succeed Multinationals copy idea use marketingmarket share dominate new product area This sub sub Reddit deny trend root underdog reality situation dispiriting 
Slack silliest investment ever Literally hundred competitor easily replicable 
Microsoft going buy Slack Bill Gates warned improve product instead He totally right 
I used work seems like fancy chat room kinda reminded old AOL chat room day 
Microsoft dominates market share Microsoft make good product I saying slack better worse saying 
I mean free v free You decide 
As person follow news communication platform go Cloud based communication tool What separate Zoom Skype Teams Etc 
Teams log randomly like 3 time week 
wechat user I still nt get functionality I pay looking slack team 
Love Teams But I never tried slack
