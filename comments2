enjoy video chat aspect integration outlook calendar But right mostly would say people overreacting angry moving hey great 
It seems le team well 
move slack team angry first people mostly angry lack good giphy integration appreciate lot There still thing tweak big deal 
This real reason organization Teams work whereas Skype Business annoying 
vary familiar time kill process freeze 
oh god hated lync hilarious though 
It rebranded lync The process still lyncexe The day dy happy one 
ca nt say nt used Slack love way Teams integrates Office 365 chat call file sharing SharePoint calendar meeting everything else 
Skype business garbage would nt like move slack team 
The two service different though serve different customer There clearly room bit healthy competition result better feature apps long run 
It much specific feature missing rather ease use polish completely missing ca nt hide side panel chat listed team hot key abysmal searching superior slack It small thing slack team time polish team sure get yet say addition sharepoint backend team team nice touch extremely useful used correctly They positive negative currently slack much polished system le clunky use 
nt used Microsoft Teams feature lacking Slack Slack chat room private message app It became thing let user post emojis animated GIF meme And let admins power user write spam bot play around webhooks seldom anything worthwhile mean hey give due But big technical moat around Slack A dozen smaller competitor open source offering copied already 
huh 
saying rather go back Windows XP use iOS 
U wot mate 
So locked overall bad 
Teams SfB like Windows XP compared 31 Slack like latest MacOS compared Windows XP 
heard Slack honestly nt seen action ca nt compare But wow Teams sooo much better SfB The mobile Teams app far superior SfB well It took folk warm Teams look feel much different Skype whole team 50 folk us LOVE It room improvement far good 
My company us SfB say 10k employee 
one reason switched Slack Discord web client slack kill resource nice work 
hate Discord kill resource worse Slack Teams combined Zoom compromised quite badly recently 
time discord zoom better D 
Compared slack team missing lot feature Compared skype business team godsend My company also switching team SfB Just north 30K employee need actually read article see taking account forced move Microsoft part 
swear think finished transition Skype September 2018 Now know roll felt rushed 
April 1st 2020 yes April Fools day 
And last year Starting October 1 2018 new Office 365 customer fewer 500 seat onboarded Teams access Skype Business Online 
Any word Skype going away 
Sounds like working DuPont They used Lotus Notes year ago switched OutlookOffice 365 First step go ahead completely replace Skype Teams chat call It happen anyway Skype Business going away permanently anyway 
How channel managed Teams work large Corp 25000 world wide median employee age 40yo All coworkers authority position Boomers still figuring Skype used Lotus Notes switched Outlook le 2 year ago Could fairly lowlevel employee go ahead setup channel way actually make sense work flow organization Will managed Boomer boss credit honestly try clueless digital text communication Or managed IT pretty much zero interaction product likely ca nt due security reason 
You migrating anything Microsoft made update 
lol yes completely realize Skype Teams Microsoft product get far second sentence said Microsoft away Skype Business What point anyway know much backend Skype Teams samesimilar used Lync remember Teams different product Skype migrating 
Do realize Microsoft owned Skype business Your company made switch 
Yup 
The 7000 employee company process migrating everyone Skype Business Teams Microsoft away Skype Business near future Everyone seems really like Teams talk several dozen people FWIW 
True recent addition tool mostly used way say cool hipster lot like allowing employee pick mac Slack nt get used much 
Actually IBM use Slack speaking former employee 

IBM still us Lotus Notes fact make simultaneously cringe laugh 
Correct 
And Accenture us Teams 
None Big4 300k Accenture 
Or big4 consulting firm 
Walmart lol 
Verizon le 300k 
Probably Verizon lol 
north 300k employee IBM GE P 
My company 90k worker although tend go back forth whichever company give u better contract For laptop HP Dell HP apparently staying Dell longterm hah First Jabber Lync Jabber switching Teams removing phone using system laptop Going great 
17k employee org Switching team next month 
Slack revolutionized team work If company tell u use MS would shitshow 
What Obviously clueless talking 
deleted 
Microsoft owned Skype business though switching 
You dumb 
Yeah large corporation likely go team v slack Mine north 300k employee switching team Skype business So number go 
This program designed team 
Skype marvel product somehow getting worse every update It almost completely unusable Either log refuse log back nt connect call trying make phone randomly vibrates reason never seen many people put much trust product manages work flawlessly 20 time using Teams better much 
My office Office 365 moving Slack Ironically moving Slack previously using Skype completely gone shitter ever since Microsoft took 
The transformation really come start building bot workflow integrate directly Teams Most company nt really get far 
It chat app way shitty netbook MacBook pro laptop Slack game changer least sometimes remote tech team 
It cloud IRC REST API front 
IRC threaded conversation always describe 
That exactly view 
Sounds like IRC business 
Just couple real world example world Google Docs notify right Slack someone commented document You reply comment right slack click link Docs We post task directly Project management software Slack integration In lot case replaced email notification etc 
You connect Salesforce approvereject nonstandard request like large discount favorable payment price increase term seamless integration Chatter chat feed particular recordaccount discussion selfdocumenting 
That nt seem changed damn thing So nt sure something totally missed nt really work u 
That one use case million The easiest answer would try 
You connect github jira Seems like programmercoder useful 
You connect github jira From get realtimestream activity dedicated room transpiring 
guess wait till company us full potential literally idea would work company There integration think u using sure understand integration real world example applies job 
disagree These chat apps like Slack allow lot integration Pull data straight necessary database display team see Slack Teams Cloud based organization become managing breeze People every continent timezone Also channel organization chat threading allow text based communication level nt seen plain messenger type chat apps 
It chat app But easier simpler better UX And better UX enough difference build multibillion dollar business 
Teams superior threading 
It pretty good If remember love know It also link well Google cloud We built chatbots using pubsub dialogflow cloud function It sweet 
You know silly thing already GSuite Google Chat would perfect u honestly ca nt remember detail something administrative side Google Chat made IT director say fuck 
What Google Chat 
Agreed demoed several chat apps HipChat turned many shitty UI difficult use ridiculous setup complexity Slack none Something simple chat way hard find good app 
Slack chat app done well nt need email among thing anymore You think alert bot notification assignment task manager build right company Slack It one stop shop ALL company communication Note affiliation Slack used handful startup joining Google After git Slack tool miss 
From see lot email conversation would previously email moved onto slack Not consider game changer Programmer APIs make flexible chat apps used As one example team us Geekbot morning SCRUM A quick daily touch base programmer part agile methodology One le meeting interrupt u We also channel get slack notification system use example telling u new code change ready review app automatically built deployed specific location One team org even built Slack integration bot use find information backend system Additionally distributed team work people across multiple country time zone Slack Channels act like water cooler interaction would normally get person chatting latest Game Thrones episode Star Wars movie expect scenario would occurred different manner even nt using Slack though It slightly complex simple chat app think changing way anyone business It small morph medium interaction take place 
Like client slack kind cool shared channel message even though different corporate slack account 
Wrong 
Do nt tell 
Describe make true mind 
Teams chat app Slack commutation information sharing platform Honestly team nt deserve breath slack team power MS behind give benefit 
realizing comment never used Slack Teams kept hearing Slack Teams clone Slack would change way business entire organization function thought maybe use case totally missing seemed like simple chat app Turns chat app 
IF already use chat app already know point Slack It another option chat app 
commented feature used working software tool also integration industry 
Gotcha coder definitely nt seem like would make real difference job 
Yes team worked use Slack MS Teams Chime Amazon 
You also manage sprint process integrating Jira Trello manage code release process integrating GitHub All app So would useful coder 
It integration chatting team ten different apps Both Slack Teams great support integration For instance channel get customer feedback even sent contact form web reply directly You also manage sprint process integrating Jira Trello manage code release process integrating GitHub All app 
At work use assign task use person email try make task something 
nt get point We already shared server chat app Teams What point Slack 
think Office Groove 2007 take cake weirdest disjointed app 
Basically If Office 365 workplace get Teams whether want It personally favorite Office program UI unlike Office program nt even integrate notification stack Windows 10 It like weird wannabe program 
Mine ditched returned slack We still technically everyone else 365 company would think single one actually use 
That probably 50 tab open chrome 
Teams decent virtual meeting thing memory hog My computer slows crawl using Outlook Teams Chrome time time go back Slack heartbeat nt company forcing u use 
Teams potential Slack IMHO SharePoint integration When set new Team also automatically creates new SharePoint site file storage etc team Our company moving reorganizing filing along line mean every project spin new Team immediately centralized spot project communication note file Im sure set similar system slack dropbox stuff box nature Teams really convinced company reorganize along line 
Teams come bundled Office365 effectively free use 
Basically If personally paying sure chose Teams Slack point unless Teams becomes much better product MS fanboys really fanboys company get hyped seeing headline like something popular nt necessarily mean better product people like using Same could said Outlook 
We exclusively use slack 
If company previously used Skype Business dream come true 
And probably going change MS already integrated office also nt sound like app use chat slack 
Sounds like window MSDOS Seriously nt mistake corporate dollar adoption Microsoft nt done much evolve user experience team nt see trying It cluster fuck people going migrate quickly 
dream day work use Gmail instead Outlook work 
THIS THIS THIS 
use company force Pretty much everyone 
What They rolling small moderate improvement pretty good pace 
It get update frequently Just past week really improved meeting ui 
They recently added screen sharing Getting closer replacing Skype 
No Slack actually nicer use opinion Since Office 365 growing well bundled recent build update Office starting add Teams It inevitabley replacing Skype Business anyone company us focus transition Basically seen valueadded product since free might well use 
But growing faster Slack Does Slack suck much 
deleted message yesterday window app 
Yes 
Of course 
You ca nt fucking delete message convos hate much Edit run window 2007 option delete message even nice little pop box say currently nt feature working 
Keyword could Teams nt improved much since initial beta release 
Teams nt standalone messaging app It much still Skype Business VoIP phone number dialin full collaboration Office suite Share work Office document directly within Teams app If fully utilizing Office 365 suite business Teams becomes central point It still shit buggy hell selling point add lot value 3rd party app could attempt 
nt know already GitHub integration Slack already probably What suggest Microsoft could offer nt It seems people migrating reason nt think would one 
A connector released June 
Its brainer u digital agency slack also use O365 We already full sharepoint installation customised eventually looked went would pay slack Teams free O365 Might 100 copy slack job 
My guess coming There hook azure Dev ops already fairly useful 
Highly Confidential type information spec code 
Github still banned discouraged list Microsoft worker 

Agreed The company contract Microsoft since use Net transitioning u use Microsoft tool like Teams Skype instead Google product 
TEAMS suck It offer way control supervision admins It charm personality Windows Vista 
would change virtually nothing already slackgithub integration good way would change anything github revoked slack integration opinion would cause mass migration away anything MSFT touch 
Github integrated already 
Probably good idea 
Google us inhouse thing git interface afaik 
What use 
A lot big company use perforce Google us homebrew perforcelike system 
That definitely nt use Github Google We nt even use git 
That competitor product Amazon nt use G Suite either guess G Suite massive Edit really question logic think Microsoft nt use GitHub 
Google Facebook nt use GitHub except open source project 
manage source control Uh think GitHub 
Yeah really worth responding everyone If ever work one superscale company see way easier manage source control rather going third party 
Git nt suitable scale Perforce sparse client make must large code base 
would surprised Microsoft quickly ported code onto github guess year think maybe But idea big tech buying githb instance run cloud sound incorrect speak Google though We absolutely definitely never change Our shit wayyy complicated would nt engineer control soup nut 
Yeah person got shredded 100 correct nt worked Microsoft since GitHub acquisition least prior also list lol 
Google literally proprietary source control internal development 
No certainly nt mean 
deleted 
They saying company use proprietary source control manage ie git server v using github 
deleted 
love downvoted hell We definitely managing source code Google surprised FB nt either Or Amazon Reddit funny upvotes downvotes 
Facebook run mercurial GitHub open source project 
know fact Facebook used la phabricator 
Google Facebook definitely managing repos besides open source project 
Absolutely wrong GitHub Enterprise popular well BitBucket enterprise No big company managing source control 
Sorry thought meant deploy version control separate task tool Yeah nt really use git monorepo scaling issue There may repos nt migrated something else yet part use version control software 
deleted 
People eg Facebook Google You use separate tool task 
deleted 
yes 
deleted 


deleted 
No git product managing GitHub Git It Git service 
Yeah sure mean Where one top 10 largest hedge fund world AUM use internallyhosted Bitbucket server 
deleted 
Google us Perforce Facebook us Mercurial sure Amazon us 
When people talking scale talking internetscale company bank 
Git nt scale well Excuse He completely right huge company monorepos nt use It awful scale Facebook Mozilla Java use mercurial 
deleted 
So wrong selfhosting github enterprise instance 
They released VFS Git formerly GVFS open source project hosted GitHub allowing Git scale merged customizations upstream mainline Git For intent purpose Windows Git 
They heavily customize git moved perforce They nt using vanilla git code 
You realize Windows probably work largest single codebase Git 
This meant git nt scale well monorepo environment company looked towards vcs well mercurial 
It mean hosting git repos server 
Yeah probably clearer meant internetscale company Rereading comment realize meaning interpretation large Still though considering internetscale company would guess GitHub isnt used nearly 100 tech worker original comment state 
work much smaller company 10k employee also nt use git It would nt work effectively repos without heavy modification say true company large repos 
He getting downvoted saying big company nt use GitHub Just top 1 company nt use GitHub BitBucket nt mean ton massive company nt work one superscale company nt use GitHub either still wrong 
ITT people nt understand source control big tech company Github git Github Bitbucket place store code Deviate get downvoted 
Fucking Christ Github way manage source control There gitlab bitbucket plentyof way manage git nongit based source control system work small 500 sized company barely know program way paper bag even self hosted gitlab based source control system 
deleted 
What proprietary self hosted Every major company host source control 
deleted 
What fuck even mean company manage source control Is joke 
deleted 
Lol All kind huge company use GitHub Completely false 
C year ago stuck NET 35CF 
You poor tormented soul If tell gigantic monolith legacy language weep 
The billion dollar company work still us SVN kill 
suppose get heavy handed company 
He said larger company nt use GitHub He nt misunderstood He wrong He got spanked trying backpedal meant use selfhosted GitHub enterprise instance pay licensing fee GitHub hosted plan position bares resemblance initial statement 
This meant 
feel like argument saying lot company host version control git version control basically separating GitHub git Guy getting lit think misunderstood 
Running github enterprise instance delete bit selfhosted git server still marginally le correct make happy 
selfhosted git server Running git server nt mean anything Github company 
You nt know fuck talking Nearly every Fortune 500 company us github Enterprise You probably nt know github enterprise software probably still CS student work shitty dev shop one would lead think considering think github enterprise foothold 
recently switched required lot customisation It still fairly rare large software company unified repository big product 
Lol 100 Microsoft us Github fact biggest contributor look repos 
yikes lol penny stock buy please advise 
GitHub used small company way used larger company since probably cheaper easier manage source control scale doubt Microsoft even us 
deleted 
would say already term flavor Or least Impossible If never told eating veggie burger would assumed eating plain wellmediumwell burger The issue Impossible much expensive 
hope Tesla story Cars somewhat difficult build flavor manufacturer electric drive x mile healthy veggie meat indistinguishable real meat initial creator loses edge 
The slightly better boca burger little harsh tried boca impossible beyond impossible beyond mediocre neighborhood BBQ level boca still solidly veggie burger level highly valued succeed could disrupt entire beef industry They wo nt topple meat industry steal good portion market 
Not saying 2 better rest field 
Does nt undermine point one better Lol 
It beyond even good impossible 
aware could nt remember one super high valuation currently 
Those company 
work 
An edge sure give 05 105B valuation edge 
agree valuation high ImpossibleBeyond burger think really edge competitor 
A company make slightly better boca burger worth 105B The whole market busted 
speaking general term 999 time could build application far far cheaper company acquired valued The value come user 
understand valuation 16 population planet Earth using app Slack Come 
Not obviously Getting new user cost 510X retaining existing one 
That paying user 
Facebook actually paid losing user WhatsApp WhatsApp taking away eyeball session time FB bigtime 
You paying user application 
Damn great point literally messaging app 
WhatsApp acquired 193B 
If well like get customer get revenue revenue justifies price overvalued 
If see missing big picture 
True Could result serious correction 
still many lossmaking company skyhigh valuation 
But time company actually revenue Whether justify valuation whole issue differentiating factor 
Ca nt fuckin wait horrible market correction year We dot com bubble 
agree today overvalued But Slack nt need Microsoft Imagine start incorporating B2B advertising platform way minimally impacted adoption Suddenly premiere ad platform B2B space saying saying potential nt defined yet think people investing 
Yeah jesus chat app worth 21B dollar valuation People mind 
Everyone You would think apparently Slack pushed Hipchat Google messaging shit show Remember Facebook Work whatever No one else either MS Teams going make come along ride Office365 Then network effect Slack done exceptionally well part lot different Slacks different topic It easier share channel partner also use Slack Slack took IRC made mass The moat point network 
Its like stuff pretty valuable problem nt moat thing Everyone 
Slack step 1 store internal conversation server 
Slack UX almost purely UX IRC provided lot flexibility choice something user want Apparently user want communication tool Easy get communicating part hosted web client super low barrier entry Easy discover channel want Easily display image 
No nt IRC always superior Slack thing right Slack get wrong Slack security alone fucking joke 
Many company email server nt want give data thirdparty They need instant messaging If free wellintegrated client popsin put big strain apps 
entire company based one product silly That would fine case slack chat app It something special 
Slack always overglorified IRC Makes sense one product software company offer entire company based one product silly 
You would nt necessarily need buy customer aiming GSuite company Lots smaller company GSuite Slack know sure company would switch heartbeat happened could save money 
But part buying customer well product 
In theory human resource cost build competitor lot lower cost acquire 51 Slack But google wrong 
Whichever one favorite make sure let know cancel one 
Already killed 4 
And announced 5 new 
They canceled 6 though 
5 get support though canned 6 year 
They building 8 thing 
Lol damn double check whether making joke Google move gchat hangout google chat apparently technically called google hangout chat rofl Could pick name Two year later Introducing Google Allo Hangouts Chat Mail 
External access coming soon 
Yup called Google Chat They released It replace Hangouts My company switched So far nothing really different You still channel DMs One downside ca nt people outside organization So think contractor noticed someone DM take second notification show window OS Aside good use 
Did nt already build And called Wave 
heard Google building thing 
They Wave basically slack never curated well The bone though 
Google would probably better buying slack 
RIP Inbox greatest email app time 
They build twice deprecate one rename time cancel whole thing 5 year later 
Googles chat apps always good tagretting messenger wahtsapp much market share toppled 
Err Google already currently heavily investing Slacklike chat app called Hangouts Chat set replace old Hangouts 
As someone extensive experience using application Microsoft definitely rip Slack Teams VisuallyUIwise Teams feel like Skype fully integrated chat app play well rest Office ecosystem right editing document within chat window Also reliable video audio chat become pitifully unreliable Skype Google wo nt build chat app anytime soon focused change adtech space specifically Amazon Bing growing quickly former becoming ad behemoth Also focused Stadia guess EDIT To clarify Bing growth 2019 largely driven Yahoo integrating Bing search platform 
Google could basically decade ago Wave demand time Same go Microsoft tabletssmartphones AOL Instant Messaging general As much people chastise company missing key technology almost company early offering long technology really took simply failed due lack timing hardware good enough clear path monetization time There almost nothing really novel Slack right place right time smart enough build decent API third party software integration 
Slack really chat app best UX Google historically known building keeping good UX product 
If GSuite business chatgooglecom Hangouts deprecated 
This bearish Slack If Google ever figure rip wholesale way Microsoft Teams offer free GSuite company many Slack user jump ship The counter point would Google famously bad developing chat apps see happens 
know team bot dump history used search bypass 10000 message 
could nt believe expensive going enterprise licence Slack JUST get SAML sign It cost MORE mid tier Office 365 subscription per user subscription include email team SharePoint think reason Slack popular SINGLE small dev team get away free account sign integration personal gmail account 
Revive Novell 
Apple maybe Especially given effort expanding service offering 
Slack waited Microsoft working competitor integrated Office 365 suite go public Big organization either use Office X per year use Slack AND Office approximately double And nt go public needed capital execute strategy give seed investor employee liquidity nt see survive honestly Google wo nt want since hangout But maybe shudder player like Oracle would take It might seem wierd much devs hate also use product like Virtualbox MySQL still even though MariaDB came forth Who know 
The network effect thing true Any software bos pull Slack rug devs basically live Just like Github superior product many devs live Bitbucket cheaper Same could happen Slack v Teams 
They exported json format But nt get private message channel would good enough 
You lose archived conversation unless exported imported Teams Slack Searchable Log All Conversation Knowledge 
Thing Slack pronounced network effect v sort apps If bos make use Groupme team whatever use nt really choice dont really care If MS team integrate office suite going straight beat everyone else corporate space 
Nadella fantastic company Has changed lot business practice culture No perfect saying But today Microsoft different company 
Marketing powerful thing 
noticed millennials office A OK Microsoft It gen Xers like remember lie shady practice awful software made ninety allergic Microsoft want nothing company The tech world would decade ahead Microsoft never existed 
agree last point like msft hasnt earned hate 
thats understandable Microsoft improved ton last 5 6 year made huge improvement It may best solution time people shit constantly give chance saying worked many people year shit refuse use product One blow mind right business intelligence area Tableau salesforce v powerBI microsoft seen much money wasted tableau powerbi way cheaper offer essentially product ton feature Yes tableau offer better visuals powerbi offer full blown BI solution including ETL almost half price obviously microsoft right solution every business problem get shit much hater 
fucking ca nt stand Microsoft Windows spoiled UNIX system tiny fast secure actually work logical reason Windows still far behind everything else despite leading market Backwards compatibility Basically every version Windows since NT running kernel Makes sound like lazy stupid dig realize customer asking At point shit give em want much happier work since started bringing old Linux laptop work It 8 year old run far better shiny new Windows machine gave collect dust bedroom 
people much hate microsoft slam everything put even microsoft solution problem make work easier instead take ascine as backwards way use microsoft product In case office 365 organization absolutely zero need slack ZERO 
skeptical They nt made client better MSN messenger since 2002 
Teams eventually replace least plan believe 
lol even Microsoft ca nt make skype better many iteration rebuilds shocked still exists 
If Skype bar beat 
You ca nt call someone email 
reason nt use skype work end email saved different folder maintain folder keep sending email added value 
Archived chat instance app Skype would save conversation history Outlook delete Skype This revolutionary feature apparently It also hook share point nice editing doc collaboratively grabbing thing easily Along UI immensely improved 
Teams blur background webcam 
What background blur feature 
Meeting recording online tie local client processing video half hour meeting chat data persists app instead copied message exchange outlook Meeting calendaring built instead external exchange outlook dependably open team immediately start meeting scheduled without waiting exchange respond like Skype background blur feature actually handy get meeting notice moment first participant join auto mute mic join already progress meeting The ONLY thing miss Skype Business small contact list wish would release compact mode option 
In way better Skype Except send GIFs 
Teams shit It overcomplicated without benefit Why team chat They one option like slack Also notification nonexistent team get chat nobody ever used team part team anyway guess kind nice business dumb use anything IT nt put computer developer continue use slack without business unwanted input 
Yeah slack fanboys Teams literally everything expect communication app We switched Skype holy shit league ahead 
Yeah nt understand hate Slack marginally better UI Teams lot feature Slack nt migrated 150 person company Slack Teams Sorry Reddit 
You missing half slack offer built apps webhook capability integration allow automate monitoring application development cycle mention easily create custom apps different purpose There IS advantage slack IT organization looking chat app yeah right 
Custom emojis Haha 
use slack team slack offer zero advantage team 
You know better 
The UI real issue team Especially trying go back chat history wait message load Otherwise really love way integrates Office 365 
used prefer Slack Teams Teams UIUX clunky feel like interface made Google Facebook expect better Microsoft 
Yeah shit 
Discord good turning mic chat always feel weird would press Talkers 
last tried use Teams little bit year ago felt like year behind Slack even good Riot Mattermost two top open source competitor space used prefer latter Tbh Discord stonking great admin 2000 person Slack If started scratch Discord Now locked network effect Slack use work really easy use social worktangential stuff time still look like work 
Such silly metric This Skype user All business Skype accounted team sell stuff Microsoft good messing metric hide really happening 
Holdin Slack stock bag 
Have Teams feature request page like depressing graveyard hugely upvoted request 18 month older status like considering implementing stage working development painfully slow It may frequent update year used update much significance Slack loved team work supposed use Teams nobody despite logged 
Especially day 
Yeah point generalize Microsoft product general day This breakdown sound almost exactly described Outlook v Gmail day Microsoft still enough resource make version software But version always worst one people hate use Microsoft developer touch human want use program 
Given developer think agree lot change 25 year Teams officially released March 2017 effectively using new software bound buggy saying Teams nt without issue grievance namely around usability think unfair software weekly update cadence used first came improved ton used IMHO Slack better overall experience compelling enough make want pay Teams choose 
Wait basing opinion using something 25 year ago We pilot year ago decided stick slack due lack integration clunky UI Last month revisited decision MS added many feature integration One powerful feature fact file system backed SharePoint synced across entire team via OneDrive allowing entire company single source date document AND built DR cloud solution well versioning Add daily growing integration MS service 3rd party service webhooks becomes pretty apparent value proposition team Now organization nt O365 Teams nt make sense 90 corporate world 
Same situation 100 agreed point You saved lot typing 
Have Teams open right using 690 MB memory 
What happens free money economy fueled run Do 1000person company really need pay equivalent 1020 people month slightly nicer redundant app already provided Office bundle 
Im developer used tool A brief review MSFT Teams No one really like Everyone worked talked happy get Its generally used suspect come bundled Office suite almost company buy It nt work well lose customer within year From technical standpoint software NOT good It used 3GB ram last time ran 25 year ago running absolutely necessary Slack Pretty much everyone really like nt make noise switching It set allow easy integration clean simple UI handle sending code snippet better chat tool used important giphy bot make conversation lot fun It also much lighter system Teams So knowing tool target demographic nt think Slack much danger longterm would happily invest given good price point 
Rocketchat better 
Any love Mattermost 
That well good use Teams work Slack personal use Must say Teams pit like one single bit care heck else integrate It terrible software 
fucking love Microsoft At point realized longer interested competing Apple saw unmet need Office Cloud Steve Balmer got lot shit giant asshole done great thing Nadella great CEO well MSFT really thrived serving business rather consumer 
Ok need integrate slack environment start looking SMAL offering pricing nt make sense 350 per user per year Enterprise Grid For chat app Thats almost Office 365 E5 license It feasible already heavily Microsoft based already paying E5 license even E3 If Microsoft based using Googles suite make sense nt anything come close G world The usability Teams nt even bad good Slack 
Microsoft always great job making IT life easier user experience take back seat though noticed younger generation wising demanding better experience They driving Apple adoption enterprise want Slack Trello Box etc Just Mac side alone sell story Mac nt second class citizen anymore spend 5 minute two Outlook version side side see full shit You greatly reduce already inflated Microsoft E subscription leadership gut stop putting egg Microsoft basket look exciting vendor like Slack Trello Atlassian know paraphrase quote start user experience work way back IT IT people mostly smart make job challenging Users 
From securityIT admin point view lot easier integrate Microsoft everything opposed multiple providersNot saying product better IT staff lot le headache 
For long time Microsoft dysfunctional company falling behind competitor several area But successfully branched cloud Azure platform They eroded EMC market share HyperV offering As IT professional adit nt particularly like product save frontoffice application database ca nt deny ability dominate MS stock one hold life basically 
Yeah forced onto people would rather Slack corporate want pay Microsoft Teams suck 
Teams utter garbage People use part Office suite Many company probably would shelled Slack regardless 
Kind expected 
That shady shit imo 
They installer install addition Teams You uninstall well 
Also impossible time trying remove team work computer uninstall magically reinstalls Btw company like random corporate computer 
Same We migrating team My employee love The functionality getting better utilize chat room daily went employee multiple little chat Skype visibility single convo It great transparency email room join via link All Shifts project like function working great 
seen anyone mention fact Teams let download chat log without paying extra Slack charge ton money We switched Slack Teams reason Everyone afraid Teams would terrible bad It slightly harder send gifs downside 
As engineer worked Teams better deal Slack better product My gut largerthannormal 13 million actively wish using Slack instead company work went better deal office suite nt realize difference make know experience Does nt make diff company bottom line food thought 
If use Teams part Office sub already pay pay extra Slack 
feel like anecdotally simply legion user migrating terrible Skype For Business Microsoft shop staying Microsoft shop nt strike sensational 
We moved Slack Teams integrates many part business better Microsoft great stuff lately really hitting user experience park 
Takeover target 
My company trying switch u team extra cost office license Makes sense getting user faster 
So besides electronic dogleashing recording everything said utility Teams organization 
Always fun trying explain new user howto reply correctly thread team instead making new topic Not best UI nt progressed year Slack simpler people workplace But advantagesdisadvantages guess 
nt know like 9 per user right Looking reduce Microsoft email office justify platform agnostic alternative It tough sell sure You ca nt sustain make decision future environment 
Slack great early 2017 Microsoft Teams took 
Our company moving team due office 365 It cheaper option hate far 
This surprising releasing number late They double DAUs next 6 month easily They total O365 base 75100 million 
But dont use So many user people choosing use 
OOF BEING FORCED TO USE A BUNDLED PROGRAM 
Slack way better Teams MS practically forcing Teams adoption bundling Office365 
learned yesterday 
Teams cheaper Slack 
It Skype Business terrible KTLO 
ca nt believe nt seen comment Slack memory issue trying use multiple workspace time 
shame since team fucking suck compared slack This literally microsoft mostly heavily undercutting price 
Our company They run slack license trying get people use Teams think one group us cause ca nt get license Everyone else Slack 
Apple fan Trying switch back Windows spending time Mac like slamming head wall repeatedly pain go away little due numbness still 
Microsoft team suck glad nt touch garbage awhile 
Totally ignores situation two product question one free one expensive 
This always happens Startups rarely succeed Multinationals copy idea use marketingmarket share dominate new product area This sub sub Reddit deny trend root underdog reality situation dispiriting 
It reasonable speculative investment 800 million At 21 billion pure insanity 
Slack silliest investment ever Literally hundred competitor easily replicable 
Microsoft going buy Slack Bill Gates warned improve product instead He totally right 
talking Slack 
mean expecting It messaging app 
used work seems like fancy chat room kinda reminded old AOL chat room day 
Indeed seems like right choice task When managing large server infrastructure always Linux well actually FreeBSD early since 2001 On hand supporting hundred user working Office Exchange Visual Studio Photoshop whatever else people comfortable using mandated switch everyone Gnome KDE give notice day 
While m certainly improved many way still come short lot support fortune 7 infrastructure run linux thousand server terabyte memory petabyte critical medical data mandated move window would give notice day 
also worked tech 20 year still platform choice MS 100x better Most complaint back addressed one way another It worth updating perception thing change still prefer unix though install Cygwin whenever work Windows extended period time 
They dominate name recognition trapped lot business worked tech 20 year lot thir stuff shit started m moved unix window stability horrible 
Microsoft dominates suite product every company depends least one kinda work together 
Microsoft dominates market share Microsoft make good product saying slack better worse saying 
mean free v free You decide 
As person follow news communication platform go Cloud based communication tool What separate Zoom Skype Teams Etc 
Teams log randomly like 3 time week 
wechat user still nt get functionality pay looking slack team 
Love Teams But never tried slack
